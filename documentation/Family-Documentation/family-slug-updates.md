# Family Slug Updates

## Implementation Progress

We've implemented the following components to support multi-family functionality with URL slugs:

### 1. Database Schema
- Added `Family` model with relationships to all relevant models
- Added `familyId` field to all models that store family-specific data
- Created migration scripts to update existing data

### 2. API Routes
- Created `app/api/family/by-slug/[slug]/route.ts` to fetch family data by slug
- Created `app/api/family/public-list/route.ts` to list all families without authentication
- Updated API routes to use raw SQL queries for Family table access
- Updated all API endpoints to filter data by family ID:
  - Activity logs (sleep, feed, diaper, bath, pump, etc.)
  - Baby information and activities
  - Timeline and activity summaries
  - Settings and configuration
  - Medicine and contacts

### 3. Context Provider
- Created `src/context/family.tsx` to provide family data throughout the application
- Implemented hooks for accessing family context

### 4. Authentication
- Updated `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` to include a family dropdown when multiple families exist
- Created `app/(auth)/[slug]/login/page.tsx` and `app/(auth)/[slug]/layout.tsx` for slug-based login

### 5. Application Routes
- Created slug-based routes for all main app pages:
  - `app/(app)/[slug]/layout.tsx`
  - `app/(app)/[slug]/log-entry/page.tsx`
  - `app/(app)/[slug]/full-log/page.tsx`
  - `app/(app)/[slug]/calendar/page.tsx`
- Updated the root page (`app/page.tsx`) to handle redirects based on family data

### 6. Middleware
- Updated `app/middleware.ts` to handle family slugs in URLs
- Added logic to redirect to the default family if only one exists
- Added logic to redirect non-slug app routes to their slug-based equivalents
- Added family information to request headers

## Current Issues

We've successfully resolved the implementation issues:

1. **Layout Nesting**: ✅ Fixed the layout nesting issue by updating the original layout to properly detect slug-based routes and avoid applying duplicate layouts.
2. **Infinite Loop**: ✅ Fixed the infinite loop issue by:
   - Updating all API endpoints to filter by family ID
   - Fixing the Timeline component to avoid unnecessary refetches
   - Removing the fetchData function from the dependency array in the slug layout's useEffect hook

## Next Steps

With the major issues resolved, we can now focus on completing the implementation:

### 1. Layout Issues
- ✅ [@app/(app)/layout.tsx](app/(app)/layout.tsx) - Modified to completely disable the original layout when using slug routes
- ✅ [@app/(app)/[slug]/layout.tsx](app/(app)/[slug]/layout.tsx) - Fixed to prevent infinite loops by removing fetchData from the dependency array

### 2. API Endpoints
- ✅ [@app/api/baby/route.ts](app/api/baby/route.ts) - Updated to filter by family ID
- ✅ [@app/api/timeline/route.ts](app/api/timeline/route.ts) - Updated to filter by family ID
- ✅ [@app/api/settings/route.ts](app/api/settings/route.ts) - Updated to filter by family ID
- ✅ Updated all other API endpoints to include family filtering:
  - `/app/api/activity-settings/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/bath-log/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/medicine-log/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/sleep-log/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/mood-log/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/feed-log/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/note/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/baby-last-activities/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/contact/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/measurement-log/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/pump-log/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/baby-upcoming-events/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/medicine/route.ts`

### 3. Update Components
- [@src/components/forms/SleepForm.tsx](src/components/forms/SleepForm.tsx) - Add familyId prop
- [@src/components/forms/FeedForm.tsx](src/components/forms/FeedForm.tsx) - Add familyId prop
- [@src/components/forms/DiaperForm.tsx](src/components/forms/DiaperForm.tsx) - Add familyId prop
- Update all other form components to include family ID

### 4. Navigation Updates
- [@src/components/ui/side-nav.tsx](src/components/ui/side-nav.tsx) - Update to include family slug in navigation paths
- Ensure all internal links include the family slug

### 5. Testing
- Test family selection on login
- Test navigation between different family pages
- Test data isolation between families
- Test API endpoints with family filtering

## Implementation Strategy

1. ✅ Fix the layout nesting issues to prevent infinite loops (completed)
   - Modified the original layout to detect slug-based routes and avoid applying duplicate layouts
   - Fixed the slug layout to prevent unnecessary re-renders by removing fetchData from the dependency array
2. ✅ Update API endpoints to properly filter by family ID (completed)
   - Added family ID filtering to all relevant API endpoints
   - Updated the Timeline component to work with the middleware for family ID handling
3. Update components to pass family ID to API calls
4. Test thoroughly with multiple families

## Key Changes Made

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - Added `getFamilyIdFromRequest` to extract family ID from request headers
   - Updated database queries to filter by family ID
   - Added family ID to data creation operations

2. **Timeline Component**:
   - Fixed unnecessary refetches by adding proper dependency tracking
   - Updated to get family information from the URL path instead of meta tags
   - Improved caching to prevent duplicate API calls

3. **Layout Structure**:
   - Fixed the original layout to detect slug-based routes
   - Removed fetchData from the dependency array in the slug layout to prevent infinite loops
   - Ensured only one layout is applied at a time

These changes have successfully resolved the infinite loop issue while maintaining proper data isolation between families.
