## Tech Stack

- Next.js with App Router
- TypeScript
- Prisma with SQLite (`/prisma`)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Docker for containerization (optional)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git (to clone the repository)
- Node.js (v22+) and NPM (v10+)
- Bash shell (for running the setup script)

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oak-and-Sprout/sprout-track.git
cd sprout-track
```

2. If deploying to a restricted directory (like /var/www), set proper permissions:
```bash
# For standard web server directories like /var/www
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) .
# Or specify your web server user (e.g., www-data)
# sudo chown -R www-data:www-data .
```

3. Give execute permissions to the scripts folder:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

4. Run the setup script:
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This setup script will:
- Install all dependencies
- Generate the Prisma client
- Run database migrations
- Seed the database with initial data (default PIN: 111222)
- Build the Next.js application

After setup completes, you can run the application in development or production mode as instructed in the setup output.

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up manually or the setup script doesn't work for your environment:

1. Ensure Node.js (v22+) and NPM (v10+) are installed

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Generate Prisma client:
```bash
npm run prisma:generate
```

4. Run database migrations:
```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

5. Seed the database:
```bash
npm run prisma:seed
```
### To run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### To run the production server:
1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```
2. Run the production server:
```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Default Security PIN

The default security PIN after setup is: **111222**

## Initial Application Setup

After installation, when you first access the application, you'll be guided through a setup wizard that helps you configure the essential settings for your Sprout Track instance.

### Setup Wizard

The application includes a built-in Setup Wizard (`src/components/SetupWizard`) that walks you through the following steps:

1. **Family Setup**
   - Enter your family name and link/slug
   - On initial setup you can import data from a previous version (just import the old *.db file from the /db folder)

2. **Security Setup**
   - Choose between a system-wide PIN or individual caretaker PINs
   - For system-wide PIN: Set a 6-10 digit PIN
   - For individual caretakers: Add caretakers with their own login IDs and PINs
     - First caretaker must be an admin
     - Each caretaker needs a 2-character login ID and 6-10 digit PIN

3. **Baby Setup**
   - Enter baby's information (first name, last name, birth date, gender)
   - Configure warning times for feeding and diaper changes
   - Default warning times: Feed (2 hours), Diaper (3 hours)

The Setup Wizard ensures your application is properly configured with the necessary security settings and initial data before you start tracking your baby's activities.



## Available Scripts

### Next.js Server/Dev Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Customizing Port Numbers

By default, the application runs on port 3000. To change the port:

1. Open `package.json` in your preferred text editor
2. Locate the "scripts" section
3. Modify the "dev" and/or "start" scripts to include the `-p` flag followed by your desired port number:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev -p 4000",  // Development server will run on port 4000
  "start": "next start -p 8080"  // Production server will run on port 8080
}
```

This change will persist across application updates. For Docker deployments, use the PORT environment variable as described in the Docker section.

### Database Scripts

- `npm run prisma:generate` - Generate Prisma client
- `npm run prisma:migrate` - Run database migrations
- `npm run prisma:seed` - Seed the database with initial data
- `npm run prisma:studio` - Open Prisma Studio to view/edit database

### Setup and Deployment Scripts

- `./scripts/setup.sh` - Complete initial setup (Node.js check, dependencies, database, build)
- `./scripts/env-update.sh` - Check and update environment configuration (creates ENC_HASH if missing)
- `./scripts/update.sh` - Update application (git pull, prisma operations, build)
- `./scripts/deployment.sh` - Full deployment process (backup + update + service management)
- `./scripts/backup.sh` - Create a backup of the application and database
- `./scripts/service.sh {start|stop|restart|status}` - Manage the application service

### Test Data Generation Scripts

- `./scripts/generate-test-data.sh` - Interactive test data generation with customizable parameters
- `./scripts/generate-test-data-automated.sh` - Automated test data generation (for cron jobs/CI/CD)
- `./scripts/generate-test-data.js` - JavaScript data generation logic

### Database Migration Scripts

- `./scripts/family-migration.js` - Migrate existing data for multi-family support
- `./scripts/family-update.sh` - Update database after multi-family migration
- `./scripts/ensure-utc-dates-improved.js` - Convert all database dates to UTC format

### Docker Management Scripts

- `./scripts/docker-setup.sh {build|start|stop|restart|update|backup|logs|status|clean}` - Complete Docker management

### Updating the Application

For a full update/deployment process:
```bash
./scripts/deployment.sh
```

This will:
1. Create a backup of the current application
2. Pull latest changes from git
3. Run Prisma operations
4. Build the application
5. Manage service stop/start as needed

Each script can also be run independently for specific operations.

## Environment Variables

The application can be configured using environment variables in the `.env` file. Here are the available options:

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Path to the SQLite database | `"file:../db/baby-tracker.db"` | `"file:/path/to/custom/db.sqlite"` |
| `SERVICE_NAME` | Name of the systemd service | `"baby-tracker"` | `"sprout-track"` |
| `AUTH_LIFE` | Authentication token validity period in seconds | `"86400"` (24 hours) | `"43200"` (12 hours) |
| `IDLE_TIME` | Idle timeout before automatic logout in seconds | `"28800"` (8 hours) | `"3600"` (1 hour) |
| `APP_VERSION` | Application version | `"0.9.0"` | `"1.0.0"` |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | Whether cookies require HTTPS connections | `"false"` | `"true"` |
| `ENC_HASH` | Encryption hash for admin password security | Auto-generated | 64-character hex string |

### Automatic Environment Setup

The `./scripts/env-update.sh` script automatically manages environment variables:
- Creates `.env` file if it doesn't exist
- Generates a secure `ENC_HASH` (64-character random hex) if missing
- Used during setup and deployment processes

### Important Notes:

- **DATABASE_URL**: Changing this after initial setup requires migrating your data manually.
- **AUTH_LIFE**: Lower values increase security but require more frequent logins.
- **IDLE_TIME**: Determines how long a user can be inactive before being logged out.
- **ENC_HASH**: Automatically generated for admin password encryption; do not modify manually.
- **COOKIE_SECURE**: 
  - Set to `"false"` to allow cookies on non-HTTPS connections (development or initial setup)
  - Set to `"true"` when you have an SSL certificate in place (recommended for production)
  - When set to `"true"`, the application will only work over HTTPS connections

## Docker Deployment

The application can be easily deployed using Docker. This method provides a consistent environment and simplifies the setup process.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Git to clone the repository

### Quick Docker Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oak-and-Sprout/sprout-track.git
cd sprout-track
```

2. Make the Docker setup script executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/docker-setup.sh
```

3. Build the Docker image:
```bash
./scripts/docker-setup.sh build
```

4. Start the application:
```bash
./scripts/docker-setup.sh start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.

### Docker Management Commands

The `docker-setup.sh` script provides several commands to manage the Docker deployment:

- `./scripts/docker-setup.sh build` - Build the Docker image
- `./scripts/docker-setup.sh start` - Start the Docker containers
- `./scripts/docker-setup.sh stop` - Stop the Docker containers
- `./scripts/docker-setup.sh restart` - Restart the Docker containers
- `./scripts/docker-setup.sh update` - Update the container with latest code and run migrations
- `./scripts/docker-setup.sh backup` - Create a backup of the database volume
- `./scripts/docker-setup.sh logs` - View container logs
- `./scripts/docker-setup.sh status` - Check container status
- `./scripts/docker-setup.sh clean` - Remove containers, images, and volumes (caution: data loss)

You can customize the port by setting the PORT environment variable:
```bash
PORT=8080 ./scripts/docker-setup.sh start
```

### Updating Docker Deployment

To update your Docker deployment with the latest code and run any necessary database migrations:

```bash
./scripts/docker-setup.sh update
```

This command will:
1. Pull the latest code from git
2. Create a backup of your database
3. Rebuild the Docker image with the latest code
4. Stop and restart the container (which automatically runs migrations)

### Database Backups in Docker

You can create a backup of your database at any time with:

```bash
./scripts/docker-setup.sh backup
```

Backups are stored in the `backups` directory in your project folder with timestamps in the filename format `sprout-track-db-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar`.

### Data Persistence

The application data is stored in a Docker volume named `sprout-track-db`. This ensures that your data persists even if the container is removed or rebuilt.
